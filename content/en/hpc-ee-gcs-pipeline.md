Today I plan to do some updates to the [Global Croplands @ 30m](https://croplands.org/app/map?lat=0&lng=0&zoom=2)

I need to do some merging of segmentation and classification. It is not a super complex thing to do just a few steps on different platform:

1. Export segmentation results as well as classification on Earthengine  to GCS;
1. Fetch exported tiles from GCS into HPC, and merge on HPC (Pleiades) with CPP program;
1. Upload the merged results back to GCS;
1. Finalized the merged results in Earthengine.

Iâ€™ve worked on [NASA Pleiades](https://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/resources/pleiades.html) for more than six years. 

```bash
gsutil -m cp -r gs://junwork/uganda/* .
